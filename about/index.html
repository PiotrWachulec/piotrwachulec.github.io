My name is Piotr. Let me tell you something about me.</p><p><span style=display:block;text-align:center><img src=https://wachulec.me/images/about_me_profile.jpg alt="Profile photo"></span></p><h1 id=technically>Technically</h1><h2 id=currently>Currently</h2><p>Azure Cloud Architect with about 3+ years of commercial experience in technologies (overall 5+ years of commercial experience in IT). Also associated with the .NET platform. Most of my recent projects were based on the Azure & C#/.NET stack.</p><p>I have experience also with plenty of Azure services: Virtual machines, App services, databases: MSSQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL, virtual networks, Azure Virtual Desktop, etc. In my daily tasks, I was often responsible for creating and setting up CI & CD processes due to the fact that I am a big fan of automatization. Depending on the client and the project I used mainly Azure DevOps.</p><p>I am a big fan of the approach that a tool should get to the problem being solved, so I am open to changes and new tools if the problem being solved requires it. #TechnologyAgnostic</p><p>The culmination of the above is my big passion for software and system architecture. Every day I am trying to learn new things in these topics.</p><h3 id=certificates>Certificates</h3><p>I have a couple of certifications. You will find the current list on my profile on <a href=https://www.credly.com/users/piotr-wachulec>Credly</a>.</p><h2 id=previous-and-other-technical-experience>Previous and other technical experience</h2><p>I have been associated with Azure and C#/.NET environment for the last 3+, but I have experience (commercial and not) in many other technologies.</p><p>In my first professional job, I wrote programs for microprocessors that control high-power supplies. There I used C and a real-time operating system from Texas Instruments. I developed a .NET application that gathered some data from the processor and his peripherals.</p><p>In my next job, I was responsible for cooperation and development applications related to SmartTV. There I used JavaScript and NativeClient (it was a solution from Google which enables to run of native C++ code in a web browser).</p><p>Then I migrated to Java stack (Java 8, Spring, Hibernate), and I prepared with the team proof of concept of the platform that was to facilitate contact of the personal trainers with their&rsquo;s pupils - direct messages, preparing training plans, observing pupil&rsquo;s progress and so on. Besides the development backend part of the application, I was responsible for managing the backend developer team.</p><p>Off the clock, I worked on a battery management system for the electric cart (both software and hardware sides). As a part of my BSc thesis, I prepared an end-to-end controller for an electro-pneumatic positioner. Electropneumatic positioner is an element of an automation system that controls valve opening level regarding state other parts of the system. I designed hardware, prepared software in C where I implemented two control algorithms: PID and based on fuzzy logic and desktop software which send commands to the hardware part of the controller and gather data, so I have experience also in electronics and low-level programming.</p><h1 id=personality>Personality</h1><p>On a daily basis, I really love to help customers to grow their business by addressing and solving theirs&rsquo; problems. I strongly believe that the tool should be adequate to relevant problems, so I try to be technology agnostic - I have some favorite technologies, but I am open to trying new ones. In my career, I had a great pleasure to work in many different technologies, so my picture of the world is wide and I can work aware.</p><p>I have a great desire to learn and want to continuously improve. The process of learning new things gives me a lot of fun. I work hard and possess a great deal of stamina. Being productive takes me immense satisfaction. I am introspective and appreciate intellectual discussions. I really enjoy close relationships with others and love to work with friends to achieve a goal. In conflicts, I always seek areas of agreement. These strengths have been confirmed both through the Clifton StrengthsFinder assessment and are reflected in my personal and professional life. My TOP5 in the Clifton StrengthsFinder assessment: Learner, Achiever, Intellection, Relator, Harmony.</p><h1 id=social-activities>Social activities</h1><h2 id=scene>Scene</h2><p>The list of all my previous ones and planned speeches you can find on the <a href=https://wachulec.me/speeches/>Speeches</a> page.</p><p>I organized an IT conference for students called DevTrends (the February 28th 2018). The main topics were the architecture of information systems. More information you can find on my old blog (<a href=https://codingtime.pl>https://codingtime.pl</a>).</p><h2 id=conferences-and-meetups-participation>Conferences and meetups participation</h2><p>I actively participate in conferences in meetups: Expert Summit, Click, Microsoft Azure User Group, 4Developers, AzureDay Poland (as volunteer at the conference in 2019 and 2020 and as a participant on full-day Azure DevOps workshop in 2019), WebSummit 2019, and others.</p><h1 id=off-the-clock>Off the clock</h1><p>I have two big passions not related to software development (this is my greatest passion for a long time). In the evenings you can often meet me on the dance floor. I have been dancing the bachata for two years. Bachata is a dance from the Dominican Republic. And the second passion is coffee. I really love to grind freshly roasted beans and brew them in a coffee percolator or Aeropress.</p></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p>There are no problems, there are only challenges.</p>Â©
