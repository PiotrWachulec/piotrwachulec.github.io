    <p>Hi! My name is Piotr. Let me tell you something about me.</p>
<p><span style="display:block;text-align:center"><img src="https://wachulec.me/images/about_me_profile.jpg" alt="Profile photo" /></span></p>
<h1 id="technically">Technically</h1>
<h2 id="currently">Currently</h2>
<p>C#/.NET developer with about 2 years of commercial experience in these technologies. Also associated with Microsoft Azure cloud for two years (I passed <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900">AZ-900</a> exam). Most projects used:</p>
<ul>
<li>.NET Core 2.1+</li>
<li>Azure App Service</li>
<li>Azure SQL Database</li>
<li>Azure Functions</li>
<li>Storage Account</li>
<li>Cosmos DB</li>
<li>VMs</li>
<li>SignalR</li>
<li>Logic Apps</li>
<li>Azure AD/Graph API</li>
<li>Key Vault</li>
</ul>
<p>I have experience also with other Azure services. In my daily tasks, I was often responsible for creating and set up CI &amp; CD processes due to the fact that I am a big fan of automatization. Depending on the client and project I used Jenkins or Azure DevOps.</p>
<p>I am a big fan of the approach that a tool should get to the problem being solved, so I am open to changes and new tools if the problem being solved requires it. #TechnologyAgnostic</p>
<p>Culmination pf the above is my big passion to software and system architecture. Every day I am trying to learn new things in these topics.</p>

<h2 id="previous-and-other-technical-experience">Previous and other technical experience</h2>
<p>I have been associated with Azure and C#/.NET environment for the last two, but I have experience (commercial and not) in many other technologies.</p>
<p>In my first professional job I wrote programs for microprocessors which control high power supplies. There I used C and real-time operation system from Texas Instruments. I developed .NET appliaction which gathered some data from processor and his peripherals.</p>
<p>In my next job I was responsible for cooperation and development applications related to SmartTV. There I used JavaScript and NativeClient (it was a solution from Google which enable to run native C++ code in web browser).</p>
<p>Then I migrate to Java stack (Java 8, Spring, Hibernate) and I prepared with the team proof of concept of the platform which was to facilitate contact of the personal trainers with their&rsquo;s pupils - direct messages, preparing training plans, observing pupil&rsquo;s progress and so on. Besides development backend part of application I was responsible for managing the backend developer team.</p>
<p>Off the clock I worked on battery management system to electric cart (both software and hardware sides). As a part of my BSc thesis I prepared end-to-end controller for electropneumatic positioner. Electropneumatic positioner is an element of automation system which control valve opening level regarding to state other parts of the system. I designed hardware, prepare software in C where I implementes two control alghoritms: PID and based on fuzzy logic and desktop software which send commands to hardware part of controller and gather data, so I have experience also in electronics and low-level programming.</p>
<h1 id="personality">Personality</h1>
<p>In daily basis I really love to help customers to growth their business by addressing and solving theirs&rsquo; problems. I strongly believe that tool should be adequate to relevant problems, so I try to be technology agnostic - I have some favorite technologies, but I am open to trying new ones. In my career I had a great pleasue to work in many different technologies, so my picture of the world is wide and I can work aware.</p>
<p>I have a great desire to learn and want to continously improve. The process of learning new things gives me a lot of fun. I work hard and possess a great deal of stamina. Being productive takes me immense satisfaction. I am introspective and appreciate intellectual discussions. I really enjoy close relationships with others and love to work with friends to achive a goal. In conflicts I alwees seek areas of agreement. This strengths have been confirmed both through the Clifton StrengthsFinder assessment and are reflected in my personal and professional life. My TOP5 in the Clifton StrengthsFinder assessment: Learner, Achiever, Intellection, Relator, Harmony.</p>
<h1 id="social-activities">Social activities</h1>
<h2 id="scene">Scene</h2>
<p>I took my first steps on stage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code4Life (27.10.2017): Presentation in the Hydepark section on how to run a blog and build a personal brand.</li>
<li>&lsquo;8. Forum Rozwoju Mazowsza&rsquo;: Running a discussion panel Fire Talk: Find yourself in IT – about possible ways of entering the IT industry, ways of development in this industry</li>
<li>Fire Talk: Trends in Java – presentation about news in Java 9,</li>
<li>IT Academic Days 2018 – Warsaw University of Technology – Presentation: Docker – from zero to hero.</li>
</ul>
<p>I organized IT conference for students DevTrends – first edition of conference was at 28th February 2018, the main topics were the architecture of information systems. More information you can find on my old blog (<a href="https://codingtime.pl">https://codingtime.pl</a>) or on conference fanpage on Facebook (@DevTrends).</p>
<h2 id="conferences-and-meetups-participation">Conferences and meetups participation</h2>
<p>I actively participate in conferences in meetups: Expert Summit, Click, Microsoft Azure User Group, 4Developers, AzureDay Poland (as
volunteer on conference in 2019 and 2020 and as participant on full day Azure DevOps workshop in 2019), WebSummit 2019 and others.</p>
<h1 id="off-the-clock">Off the clock</h1>
<p>I have two big passions not related to software development (this is my greatest passion for a long time). In the evenings you can often meet me on the dance floor. I have been dancing bachata for two years. Bachata is a dance from the Dominican Republic. And the second passion is a coffee. I really love to grind freshly roasted beans and brew them in coffee percolator or aeropress.</p>
