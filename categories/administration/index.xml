      <description>In my free time (I don&amp;rsquo;t have too much free time, to be honest ðŸ˜‹) I help my colleagues in the open-source project where juniors can learn something useful for their career. I started to deliver some infra for that stuff on Azure, but due to the fact that I&amp;rsquo;m paying for resources from my pocket, I want to have some nice notifications if something consumes a big amount of money and burns the budget.</description>

      <description>The case You want to manage resources in other tenants without additional workload around that like accounts creation for you and your teammates in the destination Azure tenant or disabling those accounts if someone leaves the team. Is there any solution for that?
The answer is: yes! And it is called Azure Lighthouse.
From docs:
 Azure Lighthouse enables cross- and multi-tenant management, allowing for higher automation, scalability, and enhanced governance across resources and tenants.</description>
