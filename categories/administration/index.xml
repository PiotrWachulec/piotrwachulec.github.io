Disks. #01</title><link>https://old.wachulec.me/posts/optimization-of-environmental-costs-disks-vol-01/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Apr 2021 16:14:31 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://old.wachulec.me/posts/optimization-of-environmental-costs-disks-vol-01/</guid><description>The greater the environment, the more likely some resources are abandoned and unused.

I started to deliver some infra for that stuff on Azure, but due to the fact that I&amp;rsquo;m paying for resources from my pocket, I want to have some nice notifications if something consumes a big amount of money and burns the budget.</description></item><item><title>How to manage resources in the external tenant in Azure?</title><link>https://old.wachulec.me/posts/how-to-manage-resources-in-the-external-tenant-in-azure/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Apr 2021 10:20:40 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://old.wachulec.me/posts/how-to-manage-resources-in-the-external-tenant-in-azure/</guid><description>The case You want to manage resources in other tenants without additional workload around that like accounts creation for you and your teammates in the destination Azure tenant or disabling those accounts if someone leaves the team. Is there any solution for that?
