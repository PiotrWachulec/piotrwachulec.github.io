Still, the entire content with my comments is available in the podcast. The blog post can be updated in the future. You can find podcast also on Spotify.
The demos that I showed during the video are available in the GitHub repository: Jupyter-Demo.</description></item><item><title>Optimization of environmental costs.

You know, someone requested a virtual machine, app service, but it turned out that it is unnecessary. Or some project or PoC finished and test resources are not removed. Due to this, it is important to look at your resources and check if can be removed or resized for example.
If you have virtual machines in your Azure environment, it&amp;rsquo;s always good to check some things related to disks.</description></item></channel></rss>
