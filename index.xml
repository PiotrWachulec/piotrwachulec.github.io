You know, someone requested a virtual machine, app service, but it turned out that it is unnecessary. Or some project or PoC finished and test resources are not removed. Due to this, it is important to look at your resources and check if can be removed or resized for example.
If you have virtual machines in your Azure environment, it&amp;rsquo;s always good to check some things related to disks.</description></item><item><title>Slack notifications on Azure budget consumption</title><link>https://wachulec.me/posts/slack-notifications-on-azure-budget-consumption/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Apr 2021 11:14:08 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://wachulec.me/posts/slack-notifications-on-azure-budget-consumption/</guid><description>In my free time (I don&amp;rsquo;t have too much free time, to be honest ðŸ˜‹) I help my colleagues in the open-source project where juniors can learn something useful for their career.

Recently I had to do that too. Fortunately the possibility of upgrade the public IP from Basic to Standard SKU has been in GA for a few days. Without such possibility you would have to recreate the public IP resource that is associated with a loss of assigned IP address - and updating it could be really difficult.</description></item><item><title>Disassociate public IP from Azure Firewall with Powershell</title><link>https://wachulec.me/posts/disassociate-public-ip-from-azure-firewall/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jan 2021 10:13:38 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://wachulec.me/posts/disassociate-public-ip-from-azure-firewall/</guid><description>With the below simple ten lines script, you can disassociate the public IP address from your Azure Firewall instance.
