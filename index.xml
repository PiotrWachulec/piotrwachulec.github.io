      <description>A few days ago I was looking for something related to unit tests in the Microsoft documentation. I came to the tab titled &amp;lsquo;Live unit testing&amp;rsquo; and I decided to check what is it. It is quite interesting, because why I have to click to run unit tests when I made small changes in code? We have the live reload functionality in frontend or some mobile technologies to see changes in the interface, so the developer don&amp;rsquo;t have manually click F5 to refresh the page.</description>
