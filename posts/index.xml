From the 1st of March 2024, I&amp;rsquo;ve started a new journey - #100Commitow challenge. It&amp;rsquo;s a challenge to develop an open-source project constantly over 100 days. I will work on a project called &amp;lsquo;VM Start/Stop&amp;rsquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m going to share my progress on my YouTube channel. I&amp;rsquo;m going to share my thoughts, my struggles, and my successes. I&amp;rsquo;m going to share my knowledge and experience. I&amp;rsquo;m going to share my journey with you!</description></item><item><title>Jupyter Notebooks for Azure Administrators</title><link>https://wachulec.me/posts/jupyter-notebooks-for-azure-administrators/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jan 2024 16:42:26 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://wachulec.me/posts/jupyter-notebooks-for-azure-administrators/</guid><description>Disclaimer This post is an add-on to the recorded AzureTalks podcast, where I went through the topic of Jupyter Notebooks for Azure Administrators, so here you can find the links and resources I mentioned during the talk. Still, the entire content with my comments is available in the podcast. The blog post can be updated in the future. You can find podcast also on Spotify.
The demos that I showed during the video are available in the GitHub repository: Jupyter-Demo.</description></item><item><title>Optimization of environmental costs. Disks. #01</title><link>https://wachulec.me/posts/optimization-of-environmental-costs-disks-vol-01/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Apr 2021 16:14:31 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://wachulec.me/posts/optimization-of-environmental-costs-disks-vol-01/</guid><description>The greater the environment, the more likely some resources are abandoned and unused. You know, someone requested a virtual machine, app service, but it turned out that it is unnecessary. Or some project or PoC finished and test resources are not removed. Due to this, it is important to look at your resources and check if can be removed or resized for example.
If you have virtual machines in your Azure environment, it&amp;rsquo;s always good to check some things related to disks.</description></item><item><title>Slack notifications on Azure budget consumption</title><link>https://wachulec.me/posts/slack-notifications-on-azure-budget-consumption/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Apr 2021 11:14:08 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://wachulec.me/posts/slack-notifications-on-azure-budget-consumption/</guid><description>In my free time (I don&amp;rsquo;t have too much free time, to be honest ðŸ˜‹) I help my colleagues in the open-source project where juniors can learn something useful for their career. I started to deliver some infra for that stuff on Azure, but due to the fact that I&amp;rsquo;m paying for resources from my pocket, I want to have some nice notifications if something consumes a big amount of money and burns the budget.</description></item><item><title>How to manage resources in the external tenant in Azure?</title><link>https://wachulec.me/posts/how-to-manage-resources-in-the-external-tenant-in-azure/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Apr 2021 10:20:40 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://wachulec.me/posts/how-to-manage-resources-in-the-external-tenant-in-azure/</guid><description>The case You want to manage resources in other tenants without additional workload around that like accounts creation for you and your teammates in the destination Azure tenant or disabling those accounts if someone leaves the team. Is there any solution for that?
The answer is: yes! And it is called Azure Lighthouse.
From docs:
Azure Lighthouse enables cross- and multi-tenant management, allowing for higher automation, scalability, and enhanced governance across resources and tenants.</description></item><item><title>How to upgrade the SKU of the public IP address in the Azure?</title><link>https://wachulec.me/posts/how-to-upgrade-sku-of-public-ip-address-azure/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jan 2021 11:53:23 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://wachulec.me/posts/how-to-upgrade-sku-of-public-ip-address-azure/</guid><description>For many reasons, you can want to upgrade to the SKU of the public IP. Recently I had to do that too. Fortunately the possibility of upgrade the public IP from Basic to Standard SKU has been in GA for a few days. Without such possibility you would have to recreate the public IP resource that is associated with a loss of assigned IP address - and updating it could be really difficult.</description></item><item><title>Disassociate public IP from Azure Firewall with Powershell</title><link>https://wachulec.me/posts/disassociate-public-ip-from-azure-firewall/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jan 2021 10:13:38 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://wachulec.me/posts/disassociate-public-ip-from-azure-firewall/</guid><description>With the below simple ten lines script, you can disassociate the public IP address from your Azure Firewall instance.

I came to the tab titled &amp;lsquo;Live unit testing&amp;rsquo; and I decided to check what is it. It is quite interesting, because why I have to click to run unit tests when I made small changes in code? We have the live reload functionality in frontend or some mobile technologies to see changes in the interface, so the developer don&amp;rsquo;t have manually click F5 to refresh the page.</description></item></channel></rss>
